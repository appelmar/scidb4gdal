#TODO
* Implement HTTPS + PAM authentication, currently only HTTP + Digest implemented
* Handle null values appropriately, scidb binary read takes one more byte per element
* Check performance
* Implement write operations: create for creating a new array, insert for insertion into an existing array
* Add trimming, slicing and maybe other queries, trimming changes offset of spatial reference!
